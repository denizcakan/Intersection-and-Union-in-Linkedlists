# Intersection and Union

Intersection and union are two different functions. The purpose of this functions is to compute intersection and union of two linked-lists. They use linked-list objects.

## Example Usage

L1 = (2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 46)
L2 = (1, 4, 12, 35, 72)
L(intersection) = (4, 12)
L(union) = (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 35, 46, 72)
